# Theoretical Modeling for Cognitive Science

A theoretical model describes, in a precise (formal) language, how we think that (a part of) cognition or behavior may work. When formulated as an algorithm, such models can even be implemented in a computer program and simulated. Simulated model behavior can then be compared with actual human behavior. A theoretical model is considered to be a “good” model to the extent that it helps us explain and understand cognitive and other psychological phenomena. In this course, students learn to build, simulate, test and evaluate your own theoretical models in any domain of interest in cognitive science or psychology.

# Cognition and Complexity

In this course, students learn to use methods derived from computational complexity theory for analyzing the (in)tractability of cognitive models, and for identifying sources of complexity in a model. Students also learn how this knowledge can be used to make model revisions that yield tractability. As two competing models may differ in the nature of their sources of complexity, the analyses can also yield novel empirical predictions that can be used to test the models.
