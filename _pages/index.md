excerpt: "Assistant professor in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/bachelor/artificial-intelligence/ai-department/who-we/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) and member of the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://www.dcc.ru.nl/ccs/) group at the [Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour](https://www.ru.nl/donders/)."
intro:
  - excerpt: 'My research focus is to advance computational explanation of cognition. I do so in two ways: (1) By developing **computational models of inference in human communication**, and (2) by advancing **methodology for theory building and analysis**. <br/> <span style="font-size: 2em;">This site is under construction..</span>'

    title: "Inference in communication"
    excerpt: "The inference mechanisms required for flexible and creative communication are remarkably hard to computationally explain. By developing and analyzing computational-models of human communication, I make the limits of current computational understanding clear. A necessary step for advancing computational explanation of the hard problems in cognitive science."

    title: "Methodology for theory"
    excerpt: "Advancing computational explanation requires rigorous methodology. Mathematical, formal tools, critical reflection and analyses are necessary. Making these available to everyone in our discipline, regardless of their background, is essential. "

    title: "Simulation framework"
    excerpt: "Computer simulations of formal theory are an important tool to understand the consequences of theoretical assumptions. They supplement the theoretician's mind. A framework to help write interpretable, provably correct implementations of computational-level models contributes to robust and sustainable computational cognitive science."
