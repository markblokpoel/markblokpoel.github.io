    title: "Inference in communication"
    excerpt: "The inference mechanisms required for flexible and creative communication are remarkably hard to computationally explain. By developing and analyzing computational-models of human communication, I make the limits of current computational understanding clear. A necessary step for advancing computational explanation of the hard problems in cognitive science."

    title: "Methodology for theory"
    excerpt: "Advancing computational explanation requires rigorous methodology. Mathematical, formal tools, critical reflection and analyses are necessary. Making these available to everyone in our discipline, regardless of their background, is essential."

    title: "Simulation framework"
    excerpt: "Computer simulations of formal theory are an important tool to understand the consequences of theoretical assumptions. They supplement the theoretician's mind. A framework to help write interpretable, provably correct implementations of computational-level models contributes to robust and sustainable computational cognitive science."
