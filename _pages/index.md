excerpt: "I am an assistant professor in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ru.nl/ai/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) and member of the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://www.dcc.ru.nl/ccs/) group at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/)."
intro:
  - excerpt: 'My main research focus is to advance computational explanation of cognition. I do so in two ways: (1) By developing computational models of inference in human communication, and (2) by advancing methodology for theory building and analysis.'

    title: "Inference in communication"
    excerpt: "The inference mechanisms required for flexible and creative communication are remarkably hard to computationally explain. By developing and analyzing computational-models of human communication, I make the limits of current computational understanding clear. A necessary step for advancing computational explanation of the hard problems in cognitive science."
