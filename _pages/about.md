![image-left](/assets/images/bio-mark-small.jpg){: .align-left} Hi there! Iâ€™m Mark Blokpoel, and I am an assistant professor in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ru.nl/ai/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) and member of the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://www.dcc.ru.nl/ccs/) group at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/). I am a *theoretical cognitive scientist* and I have a background in computer science and artificial intelligence. I develop *computational explanations* of *human communication and interaction*. I also develop theoretic methods such as formal analysis and *simulation analysis* to explore computational properties of theories.
