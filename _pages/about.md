![image-left](/assets/images/bio-mark-small.jpg){: .align-left} Iâ€™m Mark Blokpoel, and I am an assistant professor in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ru.nl/courseguides/socsci/bachelor/artificial-intelligence/ai-department/who-we/) at the [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/) and member of the [Computational Cognitive Science](http://www.dcc.ru.nl/ccs/) group at the [Donders Institute](https://www.ru.nl/donders/).

I am a *theoretical cognitive scientist*, which means I work at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology and language. I have a background in (theoretical) computer science, but ultimately I became enthralled by cognitive science. Many capacities we take for granted in our daily lives such as communication or social inference defy computational explanation. Their true workings remain a mystery and this fascinates me endlessly.

Despite the challenge, I aim to develop *computational explanations* of cognition. Mostly, I focus on [human communication and interaction](/communication), which seem to rely on particularly hard-to-explain inferential capacities. In my work, I often highlight what computational cognitive science does not (yet) explain, because I believe that knowing the boundaries of understanding is a precondition for expanding it in meaningful ways.

I also develop [methodology for theory](/theory) such mathematical, formal tools, critical reflection and analyses. Further, I have developed a coding framework for implementing interpretable, provably correct [simulations of computational-level models](/simulation) to contribute to robust and sustainable computational cognitive science.
